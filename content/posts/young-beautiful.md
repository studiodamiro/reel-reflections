"Young & Beautiful," a 2013 film, takes you on an intimate journey that challenges societal norms and sexual exploration. As someone who grew up in a predominantly Catholic country like the Philippines, where discussions about sexuality are often taboo, this film left me both intrigued and conflicted.

> I am not a whore

The first famous line from the movie, resonates deeply. Isabelle, the fictional character in this thought-provoking narrative, grapples with her own sexual awakening and the societal judgment that follows. As a liberated individual in a conservative environment, I empathize with her struggle to reconcile her desires with the judgmental gaze of society. It reminds me of the judgment and moral policing that often occur in a Catholic society, where premarital sex is frowned upon.

> I did it for the money

This raises questions about the commodification of sexuality. Isabelle's journey into prostitution challenges our preconceived notions about why people engage in sex work. It forces us to confront the complexities of human desire and the lengths individuals might go to meet their financial needs. In a Catholic upbringing, where sex is often associated with sin, this line forces us to confront the economic realities that drive some to make unconventional choices.

> It's just a game

A stark reminder of how fluid and ever-changing our understanding of sexuality can be. Isabelle's exploration of her desires, whether considered unconventional or not, challenges us to reconsider the boundaries we place on human intimacy. Growing up in a conservative Catholic environment, where sexual expression is often stifled, this line encourages us to question whether our beliefs about sex are truly set in stone.

In a society where Catholicism plays a significant role in shaping moral values, "Young & Beautiful" serves as a provocative mirror. It reflects the tension between personal desires and societal expectations, forcing us to confront our own biases and judgments. While some may find the film uncomfortable or even controversial, it's an important reminder that the boundaries of human sexuality are not easily defined. Isabelle's journey may be fictional, but it resonates with anyone who has ever grappled with their own desires and the constraints of a conservative society.
