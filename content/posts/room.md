Based on Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name, the movie tells the gripping story of a young woman named Joy, held captive in a tiny room for seven years, and her brave son Jack, who was born and raised in this confined space. As I reflect on the film's powerful narrative, I can't help but be reminded of the old adage that "_life is what happens when you're busy making other plans._"

**We do not know anything unless we have experienced it.**

> "I've been in the world 37 hours. I've seen pancakes, and a stairs, and birds, and windows, and hundreds of cars. And clouds, and police, and doctors, and grandma and grandpa." - Jack

The film's narrative beautifully embodies this truth through the eyes of Jack, a young boy born and raised in captivity. His limited knowledge of the world beyond the room is a poignant reminder that our understanding of life is shaped by our experiences.

Jack's journey beyond the room is a revelation. His wide-eyed wonder, coupled with moments of fear and confusion, reflects the human condition. It emphasizes the importance of firsthand experience in shaping our perceptions and understanding of the world. "Room" challenges us to embrace life's complexities and to appreciate the power of personal experience in broadening our horizons.

**We are what we think.**

> "When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything!" - Jack

This axiom finds its resonance in the film's exploration of the power of the mind and the transformative nature of thoughts. Within the confines of "Room," the characters' minds become their sanctuary and their prison. Their thoughts become their reality.

Jack's unwavering belief that the room and its limited contents are the entire world is a testament to the power of perception. As he experiences the world beyond, his thoughts and perspectives evolve, shaping his identity and understanding of self.

> "You're gonna love it." - Joy

Joy's determination to create a nurturing environment within the room underscores the idea that our thoughts and intentions can shape our reality. She strives to instill goodness and love in Jack's heart, despite their dire circumstances, illustrating the enduring power of the human spirit to transcend physical limitations through the power of thought.

**We are all empty at first, until we fill our minds with goodness and evilness.**

This profound notion encapsulates the essence of "Room." The room itself is a symbol of the human psyche at its most elemental, an empty vessel waiting to be filled. Within its confines, we witness the stark contrast between the goodness embodied by Joy and the evilness represented by their captor, Old Nick.

Brie Larson's portrayal of Joy showcases the incredible resilience of the human spirit. Her character, despite the emptiness of her physical surroundings, is filled with a mother's love, determination, and unwavering hope. Joy serves as a beacon of goodness, illuminating the darkness that threatens to consume her and her son.

Conversely, Old Nick embodies the malevolent force that seeks to snuff out their light. His actions are a stark reminder of the capacity for evil that can reside within individuals. The juxtaposition of these characters underscores the eternal battle between good and evil, even in the bleakest of circumstances.

"Room" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the human experience. It confronts us with the eternal struggle between good and evil, highlights the significance of personal experience in shaping our perceptions, and reminds us that we are the product of our thoughts.
